I have implemented two new components:
1. Modal
2. EditabelLabel

Modal component is a modal dialog that shows some information, if the user clicks on the button.
The user should click on the 'x' close button, to make modal dialog disappear.
In the storybook I have added three different Modal components with different sets of information.

EditabelLabelcomponent is a component that shows some text. 
At the same time the user is able to go to the edit mode.
By clicking on text the input field appears, and the user can edit the text.
In the edit mode by clicking on save button, new text is shown in the text field, on the other hand, by clicking on 'x' close button, initial text is shown.
